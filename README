NB THIS REPO IS OUTDATED AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED
PLEASE USE THE HERON MAPPING CLIENT AT https://github.com/heron-mc/heron-mc

This is the ibis gisviewer, based upon the geoext-viewer http://code.google.com/p/geoext-viewer/ 
which later became the Heron Mapping Client, see http://heron-mc.org

The geoext-viewer had too many external dependencies and code particular to the Dutch kadaster.

We decided to create a viewer with as little external dependencies as possible, that could be installed without any dependencies outside the server it will get installed upon.

Requirements:
- A proxy script to fullfill WFS and GetCapabilities requests. We recommend proxy.cgi
